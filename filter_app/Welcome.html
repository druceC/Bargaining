You will get paid 300 KSH for your participation and transport, and this payment can be extended further based on the decisions made in the games. The 300 KSH and earnings from the games will be transferred today to the phone number you gave us when you registered by M-Pesa.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0cm;'><span style="color:#252525;">Before we start, I request three things. First, please turn off your mobile phones now and leave them turned off until the end of the session. This is so you are not distracted from doing the tasks. Second, due to the nature of the study, from now on you are not allowed to talk to other participants. If you talk to other participants, we will have to send you home. If you have questions, please raise your hand, and one of the researchers will come and talk to you. Third, please do not touch the computers before we tell you to do so.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0cm;'><span style="color:#252525;">While we wait to begin, please use the bathroom now, or you will have to wait until the session is over. It may, therefore, be a good idea to go now, even if it isn&rsquo;t urgent.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0cm;'><span style="color:#252525;">We now welcome you to the session. You will be reading the texts by yourselves, starting from the next screen; please pay attention as you go through the study. Again, remember that you are not allowed to speak to each other from now on.</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:0cm;'><span style="color:#252525;">Note that every time you answer the questions, you will need to press Next to move to the next screen.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style='margin:0cm;line-height:115%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Arial",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
